# Getting Started with React

React is a powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces with reusable components. In this guide, we'll explore the fundamentals.

## Why React?

React makes it easy to create interactive UIs. Design simple views for each state in your application, and React will efficiently update and render just the right components when your data changes.

### Key Benefits

- **Component-Based**: Build encapsulated components that manage their own state
- **Reusable**: Write components once and reuse them throughout your application
- **Performance**: React uses virtual DOM for efficient rendering
- **Developer Experience**: Great tooling and community support

## Getting Started

To create a new React application, use Create React App or Vite:

```bash
npx create-react-app my-app
cd my-app
npm start
```

## Your First Component

Here's a simple React component:

```jsx
function Welcome() {
  return <h1>Hello, World!</h1>;
}

export default Welcome;
```

## Next Steps

- Learn about JSX and components
- Understand hooks like useState and useEffect
- Explore component composition
- Learn about state management

Happy coding!
